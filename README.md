# My Portfolio Website

Hi! This is my first React project for my Web Development class (COMP229).

## What is this?

This is my portfolio website where I put information about myself. It has these pages:
- Home 
- About Me 
- Projects 
- Education
- Services 
- Contact 

## How to run it

I think you just do:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```


## What I learned

This was really hard at first! I had to learn:

- How to use React components
- How to make different pages with React Router
- How useState works for the contact form
- How to make it look okay with CSS

## Technologies I used

- React (this was new for me)
- HTML and CSS 
- JavaScript (still learning this)
- Vite (this is new too)

## Things that took me forever to figure out

- How to make the navbar show on every page
- Making the contact form actually do something
- Getting the CSS to look decent

## What I want to improve

- Make it look better (my CSS skills aren't great yet)
- Add more projects when I make them
- Figure out how to actually send the contact form emails
- Make it work better on phones

## Notes for my teacher

I tried my best on this assignment! Some parts were really challenging but I'm proud I got it working. I know the design isn't super fancy but I'm still learning CSS.

Thanks for being patient with us beginners! ðŸ˜Š
